"""
A. - Python version is 3.12.0
B. - Here are some reason, why python version matter :
        1. -  Interoperability: Python versions must match for code to function properly.
        2. -  Enhancements and Efficiency: Newer Python releases offer improved features and performance.
        3. -  Safety: Older Python versions may have vulnerabilities.
        4. -  Library Compatibility: Some libraries only support specific Python versions.
        5. -  Community and Resources: Recent Python versions have a more active community and abundant resources.
        6. -  Long-Term Maintenance: Opt for Python versions with extended support for ongoing updates.

    Some difference between python 2 ans python 3 :
       1. -  Python 2 considers the “print” keyword a statement; Python 3 considers “print” a function.
       2. -  Python 2 stores strings by ASCII; Python 3 uses Unicode.
       3. -  Python 2 has a more complex syntax than Python 3.
       4. -  Many Python 2 libraries aren’t forward compatible; many libraries exclusively use Python 3.
